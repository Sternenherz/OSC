Script for Bitwig. Put it into the Controller Scripts folder :)
Enables Bi-directional Midi Communication. Assignments are possible for channels 1-16, Midi CC 1-120.
If anyone is able to improve the script, so that it can be used for EVERY midi-mappable element in Bitwig, including the Shortcut-List, and the midi cc range goes up to 127, you will get some really good chocolate cookies in return.
